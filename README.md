# CodeClause_project_name
My project is a simple yet effective to-do list application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
With the aim of helping users stay organized and manage their tasks efficiently, the application provides a 
clean and user-friendly interface. Users can easily add, edit, and remove tasks, ensuring that they stay on
top of their responsibilities and commitments. The use of HTML ensures the basic structure and layout of the application, 
while CSS is employed to style and enhance the visual appeal. JavaScript adds dynamic functionality, enabling tasks to be 
dynamically updated and marked as complete. This to-do list application serves as a valuable tool for anyone seeking an accessible 
and practical solution to organize their daily tasks and boost productivity.
